## Getting Started

**Install Docker**

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

## Stop

```sh
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.subnet.yml -f ./docker-compose.topos.yml down -v
```

## Run

If you have a partial or complete existing run, it's recommended to shut down the whole stack (see [Stop](#stop)) before re-running it.

To run the whole stack:

```sh
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.subnet.yml -f ./docker-compose.topos.yml up -d
```

## Env

A few environment variables are editable from the `.env` file found on the root of this repository.

- `TOPOSWARE_EDGE_VERSION`: `toposware/polygon-edge`'s version
- `TOPOS_VERSION`: `toposware/topos`'s version
- `TOPOS_MESSAGING_PROTOCOL_CONTRACTS_VERSION`: `toposware/topos-smart-contracts`'s version
- `TOPOS_CORE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: `ToposCore` contract's address

### Important!

To find the right `ToposCore` contract address (to be passed as `TOPOS_CORE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`), you can:

1. Run the whole stack once (see [Run](#run)) with any or no address
2. Run `docker logs -f contracts` and wait for `ToposCoreProxy` to be deployed
3. Set `ToposCoreProxy`'s address found in the logs above as `TOPOS_CORE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
4. [Stop](#stop) and [Run](#run) the whole stack again!
